# My Journey as a Data Science Intern: Five Real-World Projects

Embarking on a data science internship is an exciting journey filled with challenges, learning, and growth. During my internship, I had the privilege to work on five impactful projects that helped me develop essential skills in data analysis, machine learning, and problem-solving. Here's an overview of the tasks I completed:

---

## **1. Iris Flower Classification**
**Objective**: Build a model to classify iris flowers into three species: *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica*.

### Highlights:
- **Dataset**: The classic Iris dataset with 150 samples, containing features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
- **Techniques Used**: 
  - Data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn to understand feature distributions.
  - Supervised learning using Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- **Outcome**: Achieved over 95% accuracy using SVM and successfully deployed the model for real-time predictions.

This task introduced me to foundational concepts in machine learning, including data preprocessing, model evaluation, and the importance of choosing the right algorithm.

## **2. Unemployment in India**
**Objective**: Analyze unemployment trends in India and provide actionable insights.

### Highlights:
- **Dataset**: Unemployment data categorized by states, age groups, and sectors over multiple years.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns.
  - Data visualization using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to highlight state-wise and sectoral unemployment rates.
  - Time series analysis to study changes over the years.
- **Outcome**: Created a detailed report showing how economic policies and external factors influenced employment rates in different states.

This task sharpened my analytical skills and helped me understand the socio-economic implications of data.

## **3. Car Price Prediction**
**Objective**: Predict the selling price of used cars based on various features.

### Highlights:
- **Dataset**: Collected data on car attributes such as age, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and seller type.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Feature engineering to transform categorical data and handle missing values.
  - Machine learning models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.
  - Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV for improved accuracy.
- **Outcome**: Developed a robust model with an R² score of 0.91, accurately predicting car prices based on given inputs.

This project was an excellent exercise in regression analysis and practical application of feature engineering techniques.

## **4. Email Spam Prediction**
**Objective**: Build a classifier to distinguish between spam and non-spam emails.

### Highlights:
- **Dataset**: A collection of labeled email data with attributes like word frequencies and character counts.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Text preprocessing (tokenization, stop-word removal, and vectorization using TF-IDF).
  - Classification models such as Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression.
  - Model evaluation using confusion matrix and F1-score.
- **Outcome**: Implemented a Logistic Regression model that achieved 98% accuracy in detecting spam emails.

This project deepened my understanding of natural language processing (NLP) and text-based machine learning models.

## **5. Sales Price Prediction**
**Objective**: Predict sales prices based on historical data for effective demand forecasting.

### Highlights:
- **Dataset**: Time series data of sales transactions, including product categories, locations, and dates.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Data cleaning and feature extraction to identify significant predictors.
  - Implemented machine learning models like Linear Regression and XGBoost.
  - Evaluated model performance using RMSE and MAE metrics.
- **Outcome**: Delivered a predictive model that helped forecast sales with high accuracy, demonstrating its potential for inventory management.

This task gave me exposure to time series forecasting and business-oriented decision-making using data science.
